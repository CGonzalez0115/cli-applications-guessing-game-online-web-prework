    rand (7)
  when "number generates prompt user to guess a number between 1 and 6"
},
{
when "user inputs answer compare that to the random number generated"
},

Capture user input from the command line
Compare that input to the random number that has been generated
Print out one of three statements:
If the user's input matches the random number: You guessed the correct number!
If the user's input DOES NOT matches the random number: Sorry! The computer guessed <number>.
It the user's input is equal to "exit": Goodbye!
